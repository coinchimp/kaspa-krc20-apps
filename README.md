# Kaspa KRC20 Apps for bot construction
This repository provides a comprehensive tool for generating a secure 24-word mnemonic phrase, deriving a private key from it, and using it to mint KRC20 tokens. The generated mnemonic and private key are displayed in a friendly format, making it easy to export them for use in bash scripts. The repository leverages BIP39 and BIP32 standards for key generation and includes a KRC20 minting application built with TypeScript. This utility ensures high security and convenience for managing cryptocurrency wallets and minting tokens. Ideal for developers and crypto enthusiasts, it offers a robust solution for secure key management and token creation. Simply run the script and get started with your secure keys and KRC20 minting in minutes

## KeyGenerator CLI

`keyGeneratorCli.ts` is a command-line application written in TypeScript using Bun. This tool allows you to generate a 24-word mnemonic phrase, derive a private key, and obtain a wallet address for the Kaspa network. You can also obtain a wallet address directly from a given private key.

### Features

- **Generate Mnemonic:** Creates a 24-word mnemonic phrase.
- **Generate Private Key:** Derives a private key from a mnemonic phrase.
- **Obtain Address:** Obtain a wallet address from a private key.
- **Debug Mode:** Output detailed debug information for troubleshooting.

### Generate a New Mnemonic, Private Key, and Address

To generate a new mnemonic, derive a private key from it, and then generate a corresponding address, use:

```bash
bun run src/keyGeneratorCli.ts generate
```

### Obtain an Address from an Existing Private Key

If you already have a private key and want to obtain the related address:

```bash
bun run src/keyGeneratorCli.ts address <privateKey>
```

Replace `<privateKey>` with your actual private key.

### Enable Debug Mode

To see detailed debug output, add the `--debug` flag to any command:

```bash
bun run src/keyGeneratorCli.ts generate --debug
```

### Display Help

For a list of available commands and options:

```bash
bun run src/keyGeneratorCli.ts --help
```

## Example

Here's an example of generating a new mnemonic, private key, and address with debugging enabled:

```bash
bun run src/keyGeneratorCli.ts generate --debug
```

## Kaspa Transfer CLI

The **Kaspa Transfer CLI** is a command-line application written in TypeScript that allows you to securely transfer KASPA tokens to any wallet using your private key. This tool is ideal for developers or users who need a quick and efficient way to manage KASPA transactions directly from the terminal.

### Features

- **Private Key Signing**: Sign transactions securely using your private key.
- **Custom Network Support**: Easily switch between networks (e.g., `testnet-10`) with a simple flag.
- **Detailed Logging**: Adjustable log levels (`INFO`, `DEBUG`) to help you monitor and troubleshoot the transaction process.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures a smooth user experience and provides informative feedback.

### Usage

```bash
bun run src/sendKaspa.ts --privKey <privateKey> --destination <address> --amount <amount> [options]
```

### Options

- `--privKey`: Your private key to sign the transaction. **(Required)**
- `--destination`: The destination address to which funds will be sent. **(Required)**
- `--amount`: The amount of KASPA to transfer. **(Required)**
- `--network`: The network to connect to (default: `testnet-10`).
- `--logLevel`: Log level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, default: `INFO`).
- `--help`: Display the help message with usage details.

### Example

```bash
bun run src/sendKaspa.ts --privKey yourPrivateKeyHere --destination kaspaAddressHere --amount 100 --network testnet-10 --logLevel DEBUG
```

This command will transfer 100 KASPA tokens from your wallet to the specified destination address on the `testnet-10` network, with detailed logging output at the `DEBUG` level.
